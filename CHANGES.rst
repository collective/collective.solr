buildout section. See https://github.com/collective/collective.solr/blob/master/solr.cfg for a working example.

- Ported atomic updates from ftw.solr.
  This requires you to update your solr config, load the new solr config and
  do a full reindex. For more informations check the "feature" section.
  The feature was implemented in ftw.solr by [lgraf].
  [mathias.leimgruber]

  collective.solr.testing:activateAndReindex() to test your code with solr
  [do3cc]

- Refactor ISearch. The method buildQuery has been replaced with buildQueryAndParameters.
  Responsabilities have been divided in the search view and the utility, now they are
  all in the search utility. If you used the method before, please analyse
  the changes in collective.solr.dispatcher:solrSearchResults from 4.0.3 to 4.1.0
  You can probably benefit from the changes.

  https://github.com/Jarn/collective.solr/issues/12
  [mj]


3.0b5 - 2011-12-07
------------------

- Removed `solr_dump_catalog` and `solr_import_dump` command line scripts.
  They were too dependent on internals and had subtle bugs.
  [hannosch]

  [hannosch]

- Solr facet queries on unknown fields will now raise a SolrException.
  [hannosch]

  [ggozad]


3.0b4 - 2011-11-10
------------------

- Revert `unrestrictedSearchResults` change, as it breaks additional catalogs,
  like the membrane catalogs.
  [hannosch]


3.0b3 - 2011-11-09
------------------

- Made maintenance sync view compatible with latest internals of field indexes.
  [hannosch]

- Also dispatch `unrestrictedSearchResults` to the Solr server.
  https://github.com/Jarn/collective.solr/issues/5
  [reinhardt, hannosch]

- Tweak search form to better match sunburst proportions.
  [elro]


3.0b2 - 2011-10-05
------------------

- Facet titles can now be provided by specialized vocabularies. Register a named
  IFacetTitleVocabularyFactory utility and it'll be used to get a vocabulary
  for the facet field with the same name.
  [mj]


3.0b1 - 2011-09-27
------------------

- Extend the wildcard search term manipulation to do Unicode to ascii folding,
  to keep up with the default field settings of the text field.
  [hannosch, mj]


3.0a5 - 2011-09-26
------------------

- Don't treat search terms ending in numbers as `simple`, as Solr doesn't deal
  with wildcard searches for numbers.
  [hannosch]

- Include CMFCore's `permissions.zcml`.
  [witekdev, hannosch]


3.0a4 - 2011-08-22
------------------

* Fixed bug in `extender.searchwords` indexer - terms need to be lowercased
  explicitly.
  [hannosch]


3.0a3 - 2011-08-22
------------------

* Fixed handling of intra-word hyphens to be taken literally instead of being
  interpreted as syntax for text fields.
  [hannosch]

* Explicitly require Plone 4.1 / Zope 2.13.
  [hannosch]

* Depend on the new c.indexing 2.0a2.
  [hannosch]

* Added an `archetypes.schemaextender` dependency and register two fields for
  all objects providing `IATContentType`. `showinsearch` is a boolean field that
  can be used to hide specific content items from search results. `searchwords`
  is a lines field, which lets you specify words that an object should be found
  under.
  [hannosch]

* Standardize on `solr` as the i18n domain.
  [hannosch]


3.0a2 - 2011-07-10
------------------

* Adjust munin configs for query cache handlers to `c.r.solrinstance 3.5`
  changes using `FastLRUCache`.
  [hannosch]

* Added munin configs for the `/update/extract`, the direct update handler,
  query cache size and warmup time, admin file requests used to get the
  Solr schema and the searcher warmup time.
  [hannosch]

* Added tests for splitting words on `:` and `-`.
  [hannosch]

* Update example configuration to Solr 3.3.
  [hannosch]

* Add `getRID` and `_unrestrictedGetObject` to our flare implementation.
  [hannosch]

* Added documentation on setting up a master-slave configuration using the
  `SolrReplication` support.
  [hannosch]

* Adjust tests to work with latest `collective.recipe.solrinstance = 3.3` and
  its new ICU-based text field.
  [hannosch]


3.0a1 - 2011-06-23
------------------

**Upgrade notes**

* Changed the names of the indexes used to emulate the `path` index. You need
  to adjust your schema and rename `physicalPath` to `path_string`,
  `physicalDepth` to `path_depth` and `parentPaths` to `path_parents`. This
  also requires a full Solr reindex to pick up the new data.
  [hannosch]

**Changes**

* Added `object_provides` index to example schema, as it's used in the
  collection portlet to find collections.
  [hannosch]

* Rewrote the `maintenance/sync` method for more performance, dropped the
  optional `path` restriction from it and removed the `cache` argument. It
  should be able to sync datasets in the 100,000 object range in the matter of
  a couple minutes.
  [hannosch]

* Changed the `maintenance/reindex` method to only flush data to Solr but not
  commit after each batch. Instead we only commit once at the end. You should
  configure auto commit policies on the Solr server side or `commitWithin`.
  [hannosch]

* Adjusted the `mangleQuery` function to calculate extended path indexes from
  the Solr schema instead of hardcoding `path`. If you have any additional
  extended path indexes, you need to provide indexers with the same three
  suffixes as we do ourselves in the `attributes` module for the `path` index
  and add those to the Solr schema.
  [hannosch]

* Added documentation on Java process, monitoring production settings and
  include a number of useful munin plugin configurations.
  [hannosch]

* Updated example config to include production settings and JMX.
  [hannosch]

* Updated example config to collective.recipe.solrinstance 3.1 and Solr 3.2.
  [hannosch]


2.0 - 2011-06-04
----------------

* Updated readme and project description, adding detailed information about how
  Solr works and how we integrate with it.
  [hannosch]


2.0b2 - 2011-05-18
------------------

* Added optional support for the `Lazy` backports founds in catalogqueryplan.
  [hannosch]

* Fixed patch of LazyCat's `__add__` method to patch the base class instead, as
  the method was moved.
  [hannosch]

* Updated test config to Solr 3.1, which should be supported but hasn't seen
  extensive production use.
  [hannosch]

* Avoid using the deprecated `five:implements` directive.
  [hannosch]


2.0b1 - 2011-04-06
------------------

* Rewrite the `isSimpleSearch` function to use a less complex regular
  expression, which doesn't have O(2**n) scaling properties.
  [hannosch]

* Use the standard libraries doctest module.
  [hannosch]

* Fix the pretty_title_or_id method from PloneFlare; the implementation
  was broken, now delegates to the standard Plone implementation.
  [mj]


2.0a3 - 2011-01-26
------------------

* In `solr_dump_catalog` correctly handle boolean values and empty text fields.
  [hannosch]


2.0a2 - 2011-01-10
------------------

* Provide a dummy request in the `solr_dump_catalog` command.
  [hannosch]


2.0a1 - 2011-01-10
------------------

* Handle utf-8 encoded data correctly in `utils.isWildCard`.
  [hannosch]

* Gracefully handle exceptions raised during index data retrieval.
  [tom_gross, hannosch]

* Added `zopectl.command` entry points for three new scripts.
  `solr_clear_index` will remove all entries from Solr. `solr_dump_catalog`
  will efficiently dump the content of the catalog onto the filesystem and
  `solr_import_dump` will import the dump into Solr. This can be used to
  bootstrap an empty Solr index or update it when the boost logic has changed.
  All scripts will either take the first Plone site found in the database or
  accept an unnamed command line argument to specify the id. The Solr server
  needs to be running and the connection info needs to be configured in the
  Plone site. Example use: ``bin/instance solr_dump_catalog Plone``. In this
  example the data would be stored in `var/instance/solr_dump_plone`. The data
  can be transferred between machines and calling `solr_dump_catalog` multiple
  times will append new data to the existing dump. To get Solr up-to-date you
  should still call `@@solr-maintenance/sync`.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Changed search pattern syntax to use `str.format` syntax and make both
  `{value}` and `{base_value}` available in the pattern.
  [hannosch]

* Add possibility to calculate site-specific boost values via a skin script.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Fix wildcard searches for patterns other than just ending with an asterisk.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Require Plone 4.x, declare package dependencies & remove BBB bits.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Add configurable setting for custom search pattern for simple searches,
  allowing to include multiple fields with specific boost values.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Don't modify search parameters during indexing.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Fixed auto-commit support to actually sent the data to Solr, but omit the
  commit message.
  [hannosch]

* Added support for ``commitWithin`` support on add messages as per SOLR-793.
  This feature requires a Solr 1.4 server.
  [hannosch]

* Split out 404 auto-suggestion tests into a separate file and disabled them
  under Plone 4 - the feature is no longer part of Plone.
  [hannosch]

* Fixed error handling code to deal with different exception string
  representations in Python 2.6.
  [hannosch]

* Made tests independent of the ``Large Folder`` content type, as it no longer
  exists in Plone 4.
  [hannosch]

* Avoid using the incompatible TestRequest from zope.publisher inside Zope 2.
  [hannosch]

* Fixed undefined variables in ``search.pt`` for Plone 4 compatibility.
  [hannosch]


1.1 - Released March 17, 2011
-----------------------------

* Still index, if a field can't be accessed.
  [tom_gross]

* Fix the pretty_title_or_id method from PloneFlare; the implementation
  was broken, now delegates to the standard Plone implementation.
  [mj]


1.0 - Released September 14, 2010
---------------------------------

  [tesdal, witsch]

* Handle python `datetime` and `date` objects.
  [do3cc, witsch]

  [hannosch]


1.0rc2 - Released August 31, 2010
---------------------------------

* Fix regression about catalog fallback with required, but empty parameters.
  [tesdal, witsch]


1.0rc1 - Released July 30, 2010
-------------------------------

* Handle broken or timed out connections during schema retrieval gracefully.
  Refs http://plone.org/products/collective.solr/issues/23
  [ftoth, witsch]


1.0b24 - Released July 29, 2010
-------------------------------

* Fix security issue with `getObject` on Solr flares, which used unrestricted
  traversal on the entire path, potentially leading to information leaks.
  Refs http://plone.org/products/collective.solr/issues/27
  [pilz, witsch]

* Add missing `CreationDate` method to flares.
  This fixes http://plone.org/products/collective.solr/issues/16
  [witsch]

* Add logging for slow queries along with the query time as reported by Solr.
  [witsch]

* Limit number of matches looked up during live search for speedier replies.
  [witsch]

* Renamed the batch parameters to ``b_start`` and ``b_size`` to avoid
  conflicts with index names and be consistent with existing template code.
  [do3cc]

* Added a new config option ``auto-commit`` which is enabled by default. You
  can disable this, which avoids any explicit commit messages to be sent to
  the Solr server by the client. You have to configure commit policies on
  the server side instead.
  [hannosch]

* Added support for a special query key ``use_solr`` which forces queries to
  be sent to Solr even though none of the required keys match. This can be
  used to sent individual catalog queries to Solr.
  [hannosch]


1.0b23 - Released May 15, 2010
------------------------------

* Add support for batching, i.e. only fetch and parse items from Solr,
  which are part of the currently handled batch.
  [witsch]

  [hannosch, witsch]

* Grant restricted code access to the search results, e.g. skin scripts.
  [do3cc, witsch]

* Fix handling of 'depth' argument when querying multiple paths.
  [reinhardt, witsch]

* Don't break when filter queries should be used for all parameters.
  [reinhardt, witsch]

* Always provide values for all metadata columns like the catalog does.
  [witsch]

* Always fall back to portal catalog for "navtree" queries so the set of
  required query parameters can be empty.
  This refs http://plone.org/products/collective.solr/issues/18
  [reinhardt, witsch]

* Prevent parsing errors for dates from before 1000 A.D. in combination
  with 32-bit systems and Solr 1.4.
  [reinhardt, witsch]

* Don't process content with its own indexing methods, e.g. ``reindexObject``,
  via the `reindex` maintenance view.
  [witsch]

* Let query builder handle sets of possible boolean values as passed by
  boolean topic criteria for example.
  [hannosch, witsch]

* Recognize new ``solr.TrieDateField`` field type and handle it in the same
  way as we handle the older ``solr.DateField``.
  [hannosch]
